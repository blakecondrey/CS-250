- #### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? <br>
<p>Interpreting user needs, from discussions with the respective client, is a skill that requires repetition, fine-tuning and, lastly, experience, to master; it is a paramount driver for the success of a program. Extracting tangible actions that can be constructed into smaller components to build user stories is the key. User stories take in the scope of a project, dilute a feature down into a few key points - known as acceptance criteria - that give the development team bite-sized components to continue building the project, limiting the scope away from the final product as to reduce and refine later throughout iterations - per the agile scrum approach.</p>

- #### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? <br>
<p>As a developer myself, my future approaches is to continue understanding that all members of an agile team have an equally important and impactful position on the team to spin out a product for our clients. In light of this, I would incorporate several agile processes; namely, scrum ceremonies, daily stand-up meetings, weekly sprint meetings and accompanying retrospectives at conclusion, and the use of Kanban boards to organize and communicate user stories - in the form of tickets - across all disciplines in the team.</p>

- #### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? <br>
<p>Simply, being a good team member in software development is being a team member that communicates frequently and honestly with all members of the team. Contribute value to all meetings by voicing concerns, praise, or any feedback that is applicable. This approach invariably produces transparency accross the board, building trust and confidence in your teams, and ownership in your product.</p>
